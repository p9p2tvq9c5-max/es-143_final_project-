# Final Project: Photometric Stereo

**Team members:** Maia Posternack, Ayush Gupta, Florian Schechner

## Overview

The goal of photometric stereo is to capture a precise digital shape and appearance model from images of an object that are captured from a fixed viewpoint under multiple different light directions. Unlike stereo and other triangulation-based 3D shape scanners, which estimate the depth of surface points, photometric stereo estimates surface orientation, which is the first spatial derivatives of depth and therefore more precise. Simultaneously, it measures the color and reflectance properties at each surface point, producing not only 3D shape, but also an appearance model that allows virtual photorealistic relighting. Photometric stereo has been an active topic of vision and graphics research for decades, and it is finally coming close to being deployable in user-friendly scanners.
